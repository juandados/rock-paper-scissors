# rock-paper-scissors
We pretend to compare different model architectures to classify rock, papper and scissors like images. The main purpose is utilize a small size training set (with low scene variance), and be able to generalize to pictures out of this dataset.

The try-classifier folder will contain the code for rock paper or scissor try classification model.
